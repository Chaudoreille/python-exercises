        To control the mower, we send a simple sequence of characters. Possible characters are
        L,R,F. L and R turn the mower at 90Â° on the left or right without moving the mower. F means the mower
        move forward from one space in the direction in which it faces and without changing the orientation.

        If the position after moving is outside the lawn, mower keep it's position. Retains its orientation and go to
