class Mower():
    """An auto-mower for square surfaces.

        The mower can be programmed to go throughout the whole surface. Mower's position is
        represented by coordinates (X,Y) and a characters indicate the orientation according to cardinal notations
        (N,E,W,S).

        The lawn is divided in grid to simplify navigation.
        For example, the position can be 0,0,N, meaning the mower is in the lower left of the lawn, and oriented to
        the north.

        To control the mower, we send a simple sequence of characters. Possible characters are
        L,R,F. L and R turn the mower at 90Â° on the left or right without moving the mower. F means the mower
        move forward from one space in the direction in which it faces and without changing the orientation.

        If the position after moving is outside the lawn, mower keep it's position. Retains its orientation and go to
        the next command.
        We assume the position directly to the north of (X,Y) is (X,Y+1).
