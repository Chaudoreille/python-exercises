num_ways:

Create a recursive function that given :
    - a number X of steps in a staircase
    - a set of (a, b, c, ..) allowed steps per stride

gives the number of ways you can climb the staircase, mixing the number of steps on every stride in any combination.
eg.:
    for X = 3 and (1, 2), you can climb the steps in 3 different ways :
        - 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
        - 2 steps + 1 step
        - 1 step + 2 steps
